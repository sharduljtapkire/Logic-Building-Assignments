# Basic C Programs – README (Set 2)

This repository contains another set of beginner-friendly C programs that reinforce core programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, and input/output operations.

## List of Programs

### 1. Print Given Number of Asterisks (Method 1)

* 📄 File: `Question1.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number from the user and prints that many asterisks (`*`) using a while loop with an incrementing counter.
* 🛠️ Concepts: While loop, user-defined function, user input.

---

### 2. Print Given Number of Asterisks (Method 2)

* 📄 File: `Question2.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number and prints that many asterisks (`*`) using a while loop with decrementing logic.
* 🛠️ Concepts: Loop control using decrement, user input.

---

### 3. Display "HELLO" or "DEMO" Based on Input

* 📄 File: `Question3.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number and displays "HELLO" if it is less than 10, otherwise displays "DEMO".
* 🛠️ Concepts: Conditional statements (`if-else`), basic decision making.

---

### 4. Print a Number N Times

* 📄 File: `Question4.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts two numbers — a value and a frequency — and prints the value the specified number of times.
* 🛠️ Concepts: For loop, function with two parameters, repetition logic.

---

### 5. Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd

* 📄 File: `Question5.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using modulus and boolean logic.
* 🛠️ Concepts: Modulus operator, `if-else` condition, typedef for boolean, macro definitions.

## Compilation & Execution

Use the following command to compile each program (example for Question1.c):

```bash
gcc Question1.c -o Myexe
Myexe.exe
```

Replace `Question1.c` with the desired source file name.
