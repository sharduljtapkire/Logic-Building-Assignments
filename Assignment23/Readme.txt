# C Programming Examples

This repository contains five C programs demonstrating various character and ASCII manipulations.

## Files

### `Question1.c`
This program defines a function `DisplayASCII()` that prints a table of ASCII characters along with their decimal, 
hexadecimal, and octal representations. It displays 'N/A' for non-printable characters (ASCII values outside 32-126).

### `Question2.c`
This program defines a function `Display(char ch)` that takes a character as input. 
If the character is a lowercase letter, it converts and prints its uppercase equivalent. 
If it's an uppercase letter, it converts and prints its lowercase equivalent. Otherwise, 
it prints the character as is. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a character and then calls `Display` with the input.

### `Question3.c`
This program defines a function `Display(char ch)` that takes a character as input. 
If the character is an uppercase letter, it prints all uppercase letters from the input character up to 'Z'. 
If the character is a lowercase letter, it prints all lowercase letters from the input character down to 'a'. 
The `main` function prompts the user for a character and calls `Display`.

### `Question4.c`
This program defines a function `ChkSpecial(char ch)` that checks if a given character is a special character 
(specifically '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*'). 
It returns `TRUE` (1) if it's a special character and `FALSE` (0) otherwise. 
The `main` function prompts the user for a character and indicates whether it's a special character.

### `Question5.c`
This program defines a function `Display(char ch)` that takes a character as input and displays 
its character, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal representations. 
The `main` function prompts the user for a character and then calls `Display` to show its different representations.
