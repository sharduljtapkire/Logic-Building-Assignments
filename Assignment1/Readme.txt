# Basic C Programs – README

This repository contains a collection of simple C programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, and user input/output.

## List of Programs

### 1. Division of Two Numbers

* 📄 File: `Question1.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts two integers and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. If the divisor is zero, it returns -1 to prevent division by zero.
* 🛠️ Concepts: Arithmetic operations, condition checking (`if` statement), function usage.

---

### 2. Print "MARVELLOUS" Five Times

* 📄 File: `Question2.c`
* 📌 Description: Prints the word "MARVELLOUS" five times on the screen using a for loop.
* 🛠️ Concepts: Loops (`for`), basic output.

---

### 3. Print Numbers from 5 to 1

* 📄 File: `Question3.c`
* 📌 Description: Displays numbers from 5 to 1 using a while loop.
* 🛠️ Concepts: Loops (`while`), decrementing logic.

---

### 4. Check if a Number is Divisible by 5

* 📄 File: `Question4.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number from the user and checks whether it is divisible by 5.
* 🛠️ Concepts: User input, conditional logic (`if-else`), macros (`#define`), typedef for boolean representation.

---

### 5. Print a Specified Number of Asterisks

* 📄 File: `Question5.c`
* 📌 Description: Accepts a number from the user and prints that many asterisks in a row.
* 🛠️ Concepts: User input, loops (`for`), output formatting.

## Compilation & Execution

Use the following command to compile each program (example for Question1.c):

```bash
gcc Question1.c -o Myexe
Myexe.exe
```

Replace `Question1.c` with the filename of the program you want to compile and run.
