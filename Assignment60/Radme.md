## Java Programs

This repository contains a collection of five Java programs, each designed to perform a different task. Below is a description of each program, including its purpose and instructions on how to run it.

### **Question1.java**
This program generates a symmetrical pattern of asterisks. It first prints an inverted right-angled triangle, and then a regular right-angled triangle, effectively creating a diamond-like shape.

**How to Run:**
1.  Compile and run `Question1.java`.
2.  The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows for the pattern.

### **Question2.java**
This program performs **matrix multiplication**. It prompts the user to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices. It then checks if the matrices can be multiplied and, if so, calculates and displays their product.

**How to Run:**
1.  Compile and run `Question2.java`.
2.  Follow the prompts to enter the rows and columns for both matrices, and then their individual elements.

### **Question3.java**
This program generates and prints the **Fibonacci sequence** up to a specified number of terms. The user is asked to input the number of terms they want to see in the sequence.

**How to Run:**
1.  Compile and run `Question3.java`.
2.  Enter the desired number of terms when prompted.

### **Question4.java**
This program is a **file merger**. It reads content from two text files (`file1.txt` and `file2.txt`) and merges them into a third file (`file3.txt`). The lines from the two source files are merged alternately.

**Note:** This program assumes that `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` exist in the same directory as the compiled `.class` file.

**How to Run:**
1.  Create two text files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` in the same directory as the program.
2.  Populate these files with some text.
3.  Compile and run `Question4.java`. The program will create `file3.txt` with the merged content.

### **Question5.java**
This program counts the total number of characters in a given file. The user provides the file's path, and the program reads the file character by character to determine the total count.

**How to Run:**
1.  Compile and run `Question5.java`.
2.  When prompted, enter the full path to the file you want to analyze.
