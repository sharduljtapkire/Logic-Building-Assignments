# C Programs - Recursive Functions

This repository contains five C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion to solve different problems.

## Programs Included:

### 1\. `Question1.c`

  * **Description**: This program takes an integer as input from the user and displays a series of numbers in decreasing order, separated by an asterisk and a tab (`*\t`).
  * **Functionality**: It uses a recursive function `Display` to print the numbers.
  * **How to Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    gcc Question1.c -o Question1
    ./Question1
    ```

### 2\. `Question2.c`

  * **Description**: This program calculates the sum of the digits of an integer entered by the user.
  * **Functionality**: It utilizes a recursive function `Sum` to compute the sum of digits.
  * **How to Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    gcc Question2.c -o Question2
    ./Question2
    ```

### 3\. `Question3.c`

  * **Description**: This program determines the length of a string provided by the user.
  * **Functionality**: It employs a recursive function `StrLen` to count the characters in the string until the null terminator is encountered.
  * **How to Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    gcc Question3.c -o Question3
    ./Question3
    ```

### 4\. `Question4.c`

  * **Description**: This program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
  * **Functionality**: It uses a recursive function `Factorial` which employs a static variable to maintain the product across recursive calls.
  * **How to Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    gcc Question4.c -o Question4
    ./Question4
    ```

### 5\. `Question5.c`

  * **Description**: This program calculates the product of the digits of an integer entered by the user.
  * **Functionality**: It uses a recursive function `Mult` to compute the product of individual digits.
  * **How to Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    gcc Question5.c -o Question5
    ./Question5
    ```
