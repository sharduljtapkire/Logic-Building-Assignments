This directory contains four C programs:

* **Question1.c:** This program takes an integer as input and prints "Small" if the number is less than 50, "Medium" if the number is between 50 and 100 (exclusive), and "Large" if the number is greater than or equal to 100.

* **Question2.c:** This program calculates the factorial of a given integer. It returns an error message "Invalid input" if the input is negative.

* **Question3.c:** This program takes an integer as input and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

* **Question4.c:** This program takes an integer as input and prints its multiplication table from 10 down to 1.

How to compile and run the programs:

1.  **Compilation:**
    Use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the programs.  For example, to compile `Question1.c`, use the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc Question1.c -o Myexe
    ```

    Repeat this for each of the `.c` files, changing the output name accordingly.

2.  **Execution:**
    After successful compilation, you can run the programs from the command line.  For example, to run the compiled `Question1` program:

    ```bash
    Myexe.exe
    ```

    The program will then prompt you for input as required.
