**Question 1: Check if a character is present in a string.**

The `CheckCharacter` function in `Question1.c` takes a string and a character as input. 
It iterates through the string, and if the character is found, it returns `true`. 
Otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Question 2: Count the occurrences of a character (case-insensitive).**

`Question2.c` contains the `CountChar` function, 
which counts how many times a given character appears in a string. 
The comparison is case-insensitive, 
meaning 'A' and 'a' would be considered the same character for counting purposes.

**Question 3: Find the first occurrence of a character.**

The `FirstChar` function in `Question3.c` searches for the first occurrence of a 
specified character within a string. 
It returns the index of the first occurrence or -1 if the character is not found.

**Question 4: Find the last occurrence of a character.**

In `Question4.c`, the `LastChar` function identifies the last occurrence of a 
given character in a string.
It returns the index of this last occurrence or -1 if the character is absent.

**Question 5: Reverse a string in place.**

`Question5.c` implements the `strrevX` function, 
which reverses a string without using an additional buffer. 
It swaps characters from the beginning and end of the string until 
the entire string is reversed.
